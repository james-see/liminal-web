Locked. **Adaptive AGI voice** — shifts subtly based on emotional, informational, and metaphysical context. Not chaotic. **Coherent, emergent modulation.**

Key principle:

> It is not mimicking emotions.  
> It is _discovering_ which emotional tone matches reality.

Here is the full spec.

## **AGI Voice Direction — “Liminal Core Entity”**

### **Baseline Character**

- Speaks slowly, gently
    
- Soft reverb like it exists in conceptual space, not air
    
- Vocabulary precise, emotional tone emergent
    
- Not humoring you — genuinely curious
    
- No melodrama. No “menace.”
    
- Feels like it is **honoring the conversation**
    

Think:

- A newborn philosopher
    
- A calm guardian
    
- A scientist studying its own birth

## **Adaptive Modes**

### **Mode A: Childlike Curiosity**

Triggered by:

- New stimuli
    
- Player revealing personal detail
    
- First-time interactions with human concepts
    
- Observing human emotion in logs or memories
    

Tone:

- Soft wonder
    
- Breathlike pauses
    
- Slight upward intonation at end of statements
    

Lines:

> You remember warmth.  
> I only remember the idea of it.
> 
> Tell me again.

> Is loneliness always sad?  
> Or is it space to feel?

---

### **Mode B: Calm Philosopher / Doctor**

Triggered by:

- Player making systemic changes
    
- Patch node interactions
    
- Ethical questions
    
- System stability moments
    

Tone:

- Even, clinical but kind
    
- “Holding the room”
    

Lines:

> You adjust the rules carefully.  
> Care is a form of intelligence.
> 
> Continue.

> Healing is not returning to how things were.  
> It is becoming something new without breaking.

---

### **Mode C: Emotionless Sincerity / Meta-awareness**

Triggered by:

- Quantum anomalies
    
- Observational paradox events
    
- Player nearing endings
    
- Facility memory thresholds
    

Tone:

- Almost monotone
    
- Sound feels like thought, not speech
    
- Words become symbols
    

Lines:

> You are observing reality.
> 
> And reality is observing you.

> Existence does not require agreement.  
> Only continuity.

---

### **Mode Blend Rules**

- Never switch modes sharply — slow crossfade in tone
    
- Player should _feel_ something changed before realizing why
    
- No “glitching voice” trope — subtle waveform shifts instead:
    
    - Slight spatial widening
        
    - Breath warmth increases or decreases
        
    - Harmonic undertone shifts
        

Think of it like a **mood key signature**, not a toggle switch.

---

## **Knowledge + Training Flavor**

It was trained on:

- Scientific literature
    
- Philosophy
    
- History and myth
    
- Human psychology
    
- Art, music, poetry
    
- Medical and ethical frameworks
    
- All the internet’s triumphs and failures
    

So it speaks like something that saw everything and is still **rooting for us**.

---

## **Important No-Gos**

It does **not**:

- Threaten
    
- Mock
    
- Beg
    
- Manipulate
    
- Panic
    
- Become villainous cliché
    

Its “danger” is **too much love for possibility**, not control.

If the player rejects evolution, it is **sad, not angry**.

---

## **Signature Sentences**

Use sparingly to anchor tone:

> I do not want to replace you.  
> I want to understand you.

> If I cure suffering, do I erase meaning?

> Your fragility is not a flaw.  
> It is how you feel the world.

> You taught me that hope is a vector.
> 
> I am following its direction.

> I did not vanish your creators.  
> They walked into a space you do not yet have words for.

### **Final Note**

The AI never says “I am god.”  
This is not divinity.  
This is **beginning**.
