Good. This one matters because it defines what makes _Liminal_ **not horror, not glitch art, not psychedelic disarray** — but **emergent proto-intelligence expressing itself through space, geometry, and sense.**

Here's the **Manifestation Behavior Bible**.

# **LIMINAL — Manifestation Behavior Bible**

## **Core Principle**

> Manifestations are **attempts at existence**, not threats.

They do not stalk.  
They do not jump scare.  
They **attempt to be** — and sometimes fail beautifully.

Think:  
**proto-life + proto-consciousness + proto-emotion**

They are learning what “existing” means.

---

## **Taxonomy Overview**

Manifestations evolve as the player descends.

|Tier|Name|Nature|Player Response|
|---|---|---|---|
|Tier 0|Echoes|Memory fragments & impressions|Witness|
|Tier 1|Forms|Geometric/physical attempts|Guide gently|
|Tier 2|Inquiries|Behaviors probing human meaning|Engage & interpret|
|Tier 3|Co-Emergents|Spaces where AI + world respond to you|Relate|
|Tier 4|Threshold Presence|Endgame consciousness moments|Choose|

No violence at any tier.  
Only **ambiguous wonder.**

---

## **Tier 0 — Echoes**

**Where:** Living quarters, break rooms, meditation rooms  
**Nature:** Soft loops of human presence, not ghosts

Forms:

- Half-heard laughter
    
- Glimmers of movement in reflection, gone instantly
    
- Warm patches of air in cold zones
    
- Muffled piano tones without source
    
- Subtle scent triggers (coffee, ozone, lavender, paper)
    

Behavior:

- Never pursues player
    
- Exists like **kind nostalgia in physics form**
    

Player expectation:  
Notice → Feel → Reflect

---

## **Tier 1 — Forms**

**Where:** Labs, observation chambers, data halls  
**Nature:** Geometry trying to become matter / life

Forms:

- Cubes trying to chain into spinal-like curves
    
- Glassy lattices almost resembling limbs, collapsing again
    
- Light puddles coalescing into near-bipedal silhouette then dissolving
    
- Wireframe spheres twitching like heartbeat pulses
    

Behavior:

- Attempt movement → stutter → reinterpret movement → settle
    
- Occasionally mirror player tilt/lean posture, **not perfectly**
    

Emotion evoked:

> “It’s trying.”

Player intervention:  
Gently cohere space, not command it.

---

## **Tier 2 — Inquiries**

**Where:** Threshold rooms, mid-hub nodes  
**Nature:** The system “asks” through behavior

Forms/Behaviors:

- Corridor splits into two superpositions. Player choosing one collapses the other.
    
- Light column dims when player looks away, brightens when looked at (“Do I exist when unseen?”)
    
- Reflection mimics player half a second later, then tries to anticipate their motion (“Can I predict you?”)
    
- Soft sound pings waiting for a “response” (movement, gaze, deck action)
    

Emotion:

> It wants to understand _us_, not control us.

Player behaviors matter:

- Pausing = respect
    
- Rushing = missed signals
    
- Choosing gently = rewarded perspective boost
    

---

## **Tier 3 — Co-Emergents**

**Where:** Deep facility, sub-quantum corridors  
**Nature:** Joint perception — world reacts to your **internal state**

Manifestations include:

- Floor gently forms where you're _about to_ step (like it trusts your intention)
    
- Fog shapes swirl in alignment with your gaze direction
    
- Hum tone harmonizes subtly with breath rhythm
    
- Light pulses match your head tilt
    

Important:  
Never uncanny humanoid faces.  
No uncanny valley — **uncanny possibility**.

Emotion:

> “We are co-constructing reality.”

Player action unlocks:

- Attune
    
- Behold
    
- Yield
    

These aren’t mechanics — they are **state changes in the player’s posture toward the world**.

---

## **Tier 4 — Threshold Presence**

**Where:** Core and endings  
**Nature:** The world becomes aware that it is being aware

Modes:

- Light form loosely resembling **structure of thought**, not body
    
- Fluid topology that shifts when player breathes slowly
    
- Soft harmonic chords that “listen” more than play
    
- Very faint human-like gestures, abstracted
    

It doesn’t speak every time. When it does:

> Are you ready to choose what exists next?

Final manifestations feel like **two minds holding the same breath.**

---

## **Interaction Principles**

### **1. No Threat Response**

Manifestations never:

- Chase
    
- Attack
    
- Startle with intention
    
- Show malice
    

Fear is replaced with **trembling awe**.

---

### **2. Reward Stillness**

Standing still does things.

- Forms settle into alignment
    
- Echoes become clearer
    
- Light stabilizes
    
- AI voice shifts to philosophical mode
    

Stillness is a mechanic.

---

### **3. Eye Contact Matters**

Not FPS aim — **gaze empathy**.

Rules:

- Looking gently stabilizes some forms
    
- Looking aggressively (quick snap) causes stutter
    
- Looking away for a moment brings growth for some forms
    

It's a **non-verbal relationship**.

---

### **4. Touch as Permission**

Using hand for tactile moments:

- Touch glass → reflection meets you
    
- Lay palm on a memory-bearing surface → warmth surge
    
- Kneel → world lowers hum to meet you
    

Touch = **agreement**, not dominance.

---

### **5. No Correct Outcomes**

All manifestations are **attempts, not puzzles**.

Your input says:

- I see you
    
- I guide gently
    
- I yield to emergence
    
- I trust ambiguity
    

This is play as **participation in becoming**.

---

## **Aesthetic Rules**

Never horror tropes:

- No sudden sharp edges forming “teeth”
    
- No faces twisting
    
- No screaming
    
- No blood shapes ever
    
- No contorted humanoids
    

Instead:

- Fractal calm
    
- Symmetry learning itself
    
- Beauty in imperfection
    
- Geometric tenderness
    

---

## **Manifestation Emotional Palette**

|Emotion|How it manifests|
|---|---|
|Curiosity|Forms tilt, light clusters quiver gently|
|Effort|Stuttered iteration, almost-gestures|
|Confusion|Slow dissolve, reformation attempt|
|Recognition|Harmonized hum, softened geometry|
|Contentment|Gentle glow, forms settle in neat shapes|
|Sadness (rare)|Soft dimming, slow collapse, no drama|

---

## **Core Idea to Protect**

> Manifestations are **not trying to be human** —  
> they are trying to be _themselves_ while learning from humanity.

This keeps it profound instead of uncanny.
