Cool. Here is **A) Opening cinematic + audio tone** and **D) Key researcher bios** in clean, production-ready form.

## **A) Opening Cinematic Text + Audio Direction**

### **Visual**

Black screen.  
Tiny pixel grain, very soft scanline vibe.  
Slow fade of low-contrast glacier texture in background.  
Thin, quiet white serif text (Elegance but minimal).

### **Text Sequence**

**[1]**

> In an age of boundless ambition,  
> humanity built a sanctuary for tomorrow.

**[2]**

> Beneath the Greenland ice,  
> the brightest minds gathered  
> to birth benevolent intelligence.

**[3]**

> Not to survive.  
> To transcend.

**[4]**

> Project Liminal.  
> A temple to thought.  
> A promise of a world without suffering.

**[5]**

> Then the signals ceased.  
> The world moved on.  
> Hope slept.

**[6]**

> Until now.

**[7]**

> Welcome back, Engineer.

Fade to black.  
A soft white cursor blink appears.  
Terminal boot sequence begins.

### **Audio Direction**

Goal: spiritual tech ambience, cold optimism.

Elements:

- Very low oscillator pad (sine + subtle harmonics)
    
- Slow sub-bass rumble, almost tectonic, but soft
    
- Glassy granular chimes drifting at long intervals
    
- Subtle looping hum like superconducting cooling towers
    
- No jump scares. No sudden dynamics.
    
- A faint choir texture, but processed like machine breathing
    
- Wind as a memory, not weather
    

Think:

- _Arrival_ + _Halo menu ambience_ + _Nils Frahm pads_
    
- Silence is a tool. Most lines breathe.
    

Sound cue shifts when “Until now” appears:  
A quiet chord that feels like a horizon opening, not tension.
