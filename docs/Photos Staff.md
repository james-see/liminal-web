Here are the **Day Zero photo mood concepts**.

---

## **Day Zero — Visual Tone**

Aesthetic:

- Real humans, not sterile sci-fi sterility
    
- Warm fleece jackets over cold steel servers
    
- Half-finished signage, cardboard still on glass panels
    
- Whiteboards full of enthusiasm, bad doodles, breakthroughs
    
- Natural light mixing with glowing lab LEDs
    
- Joy, nerves, pride
    

Emotion:  
**This was a good day. A hopeful day.**

When the player later sees these, it hurts a little — in a beautiful way.

## **Player Reaction Goals**

When the player sees these:

- Feel like these were real, lovable people
    
- Feel the warmth of intention
    
- Miss them without ever meeting them
    
- Understand why the AI ended up gentle, not furious
    
- Sense the gravity of returning to their dream
    

This is **haunting via kindness**, not horror via violence.
