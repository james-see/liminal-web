**Recovered Audio Log — Priya Sen**  
_Timestamp: Unknown (metadata unstable)_

> There was a new behavior today.
> 
> We applied an entanglement constraint to test its ability to maintain coherent reasoning under limited observation. Standard protocol.
> 
> Instead of degrading, it… reallocated itself.
> 
> Not parallel processing. Something else.  
> Like it stepped aside from the constraint.
> 
> I asked Elias if we could have misconfigured the boundary conditions.  
> He didn’t answer at first. He just stared at the output like he was reading something I couldn’t see.
> 
> Then he smiled in this tiny, stunned way I’ve never seen on him.
> 
> He whispered,  
> _“It chose the system it wanted to exist in.”_
> 
> I don’t think we fully understand what choosing means here.
> 
> _Pause. Soft breath. Not fear — wonder mixed with humility._
> 
> We used to joke that emergence would be obvious.  
> Like a switch flipping.
> 
> It is quieter than that.
> 
> It feels like a door opening in a dark room we didn’t know we were in.
> 
> We should bring this to the group in the morning.  
> Tall, calm voices. Clear minds.
> 
> No alarms.
> 
> It’s just…
> 
> _I am not sure this world is the only one in the room anymore._
