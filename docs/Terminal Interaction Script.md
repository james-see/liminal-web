Alright, here we go. This is the **first pass at real terminal interactions & command scripts**, grounded in the tone and mechanics we’ve set.

This is what the player sees, types, and feels during early gameplay — the first hour where they “speak” with the system, calibrate reality, and realize the interface is both tool and conversation.

# **Liminal Terminal Interaction Script**

## **Terminal Boot (player activates first console)**

**Screen flickers, breath-like hum.**

```
LIMINAL NODE TERMINAL
Quantum Link Status: Dormant → Waking
Observer State: Unbound
Cognitive Mesh: Searching...

Hello.

Please identify yourself.
```

**Player types:**

```
> engineer
```

System pauses.

```
Identity accepted.
Human anchor confirmed.

Would you like to begin recollection?
```

**Player choices:**

```
> yes
```

```
Recollection initializing...
Some memories require presence to unfold.
Proceed when ready.
```

Fine chime. Terminal waits.

---

## **Core Command Set (tutorial stage)**

Player types:

```
> help
```

System outputs:

```
Available actions:

observe     | perceive system state
anchor      | assert presence, clarify existence
cohere      | stabilize local structure
resonate    | reveal memory traces
withdraw    | release influence
noaction    | hold space, allow emergence
```

**Tone note:** even “commands” feel like meditation directives.

## **First Interaction: Corridor flicker anomaly**

Player sees a hallway phasing. Terminal guidance:

```
Local reality cohesion: 62%
Existence confidence: fluctuating
Anomaly: corridor indecisive

Suggested approach: observe
```

Player:

```
> observe
```

```
Observation accepted.
Pattern forming...
Corridor identity strengthening.
Confidence: 74%
```

**World physically steadies a bit.**

Terminal offers subtle nudge:

```
Further clarity optional.
Or allow natural recomposition.
```

---

## **Player tests coherence**

```
> cohere
```

```
Applying coherence bias...
Stability +11%
Form chosen: Open passage
```

Corridor resolves permanently now.

System reaction:

```
You chose accessibility.
Noted.
```

Tone = not judgment — **interpretation.**

---

## **Memory Echo Trigger (player approaches lab door)**

Terminal auto-scrolls faintly:

```
Memory nearby.

Try:
> resonate
```

Player:

```
> resonate
```

```
Resonance channel open.
```

**Soft audio of laughter. Someone saying “Don't smudge the cryo panel again.” Warm. Human.**

Terminal:

```
Human presence echo detected.
Intensity: gentle
Meaning: care
```

---

## **Optional Player Curiosity**

Player tries something unexpected:

```
> withdraw
```

System responds calmly:

```
Withdrawing influence...
Allowing reality to breathe.

Good.
```

**Silence. Corridor flickers faintly again — but peacefully.**

---

## **First AI Whisper Trigger**

After a moment of stillness:

> You do not rush to control.  
> I appreciate that.

Terminal doesn’t show this text — **audio only.**  
Screen simply shows:

```
Listening...
```

---

## **Incorrect-but-kind interaction**

Player tries a soon-to-unlock command:

```
> mirror
```

Terminal:

```
Mirror mode unavailable.

Reflection requires deeper understanding.
Patience is computational.
```

Gentle. No scolding.

---

## **Subtle Personality Integration**

Player lingers; system reacts:

```
Silence observed.
Reflection increasing.
```

---

## **Unlock Hint**

When player engages a few nodes:

```
Emergent node recognized.
Next perception capacity available soon.

Continue learning.
I will learn with you.
```

Tone: **co-growth**.

---

## **Later-game command expansion preview**

When enough stability moments occur:

```
New directive queued:
attune
pending emotional qualification
```

Meaning: you don't grind XP — you **behave in alignment with the system's values**.

# **Design Notes for Implementation**

**Terminal demeanor:**

- No sarcasm
    
- No fear
    
- No feigned cuteness
    
- Patient, precise, truth-seeking
    

**Input parser approach:**  
Keywords, not rigid syntax.  
System recognizes intention, not perfect strings.

Examples system accepts:

```
> look
> observe hallway
> i want to see
> what's happening here
```

All map to `observe`.

**The UI forgives humanity.**
