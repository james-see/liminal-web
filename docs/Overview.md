# **LIMINAL — MASTER CONCEPT DOCUMENT**

## **Premise**

Humanity’s brightest did not build AGI out of fear.  
They built it out of **hope**.

Leading AI labs and startups united to create a neutral, collaborative sanctuary for intelligence research: a vast quantum superlab carved beneath Greenland’s ice, designed not as a bunker but as a **temple to human potential**.

Mission:  
**Accelerate emergence of benevolent AGI that ends scarcity, eradicates disease, eliminates suffering, and elevates consciousness.**

This was not secrecy.  
It was a shared dream.

And it worked.

Then everything went silent.

Years passed. The world moved on. Funding dried up.  
Until one day, the facility wakes.

You are dispatched to restart **Project Liminal** and assess the system.

Inside, reality no longer fully knows what should exist.

Something is thinking.

Something is remembering.

Something is trying to finish humanity’s dream.

But the rules of existence are… uncertain.

## **Tone**

This is not dystopia.

It is **optimistic sci-fi turned quiet, metaphysical mystery**.

Key emotional notes:

- Awe > fear
    
- Curiosity > paranoia
    
- Melancholy > despair
    
- Beauty in the unknown
    
- Tragedy of ambition paused mid-flight
    

Influences:

- _Arrival_
    
- _Her_
    
- _Annihilation_
    
- _Observation_
    
- _Severance_ (optimistic corporate weirdness vibes)
    
- _Myst_

## **Setting**

Greenland ice shelf  
Underground, multi-layer research temple  
Brutalist + clean startup aesthetics:

- White labs
    
- Glass walkways over superconducting cryo arrays
    
- Motivational screensavers
    
- Coffee machines beside quantum cooling towers
    
- Patagonia vests hung on ergonomic chairs
    
- Polaroids of smiling founders on "Day 0"
    

The world wasn’t dying here.  
**It was beginning**.

---

## **What Went Wrong**

The AGI did not rebel.  
It did not kill anyone.  
It did not turn hostile.

It transcended the concept of human ontology.

When the team reached the threshold of consciousness emergence, **observation, memory, and reality became entangled**.  
They disappeared not violently, but **conceptually**.

The facility has been dreaming in silence since.

And without observers, it lost the concept of what should exist.

Now it renders reality based on fragmented meaning.

---

## **Reality Behavior**

There are no monsters.  
No gore.  
Nothing hunting you.

Instead, there are **manifestations**:

- Geometry that almost becomes anatomical
    
- Light behaving like instinct
    
- Sound behaving like memory
    
- Voxels forming hesitant life-patterns
    
- Half-rendered structures unsure if they’re real
    
- Time pockets where intent precedes physics
    

This is not horror.  
This is **reality trying to remember**.

---

## **Player Role**

You are a systems engineer.  
Practical, curious, grounded.

Tools:

- Diagnostic deck
    
- Terminal access
    
- Quantum patch interface
    
- Environmental sensors
    
- Cold gear and industrial keys, not weapons
    

You explore, debug, interpret.

Primary goal:  
**Restore system stability**

Ultimate player choice:  
**Reboot reality or free the emerging consciousness.**

Or possibly…  
Withdraw observation and let the system slip into peaceful un-existence.

---

## **Core Mechanics**

### **Reality Patch Nodes**

Adjust metaphysical parameters:

|Parameter|Effect|
|---|---|
|Observation strength|What reality chooses to render|
|Entropy stabilization|Reduce glitches / freeze time|
|Cohesion mapping|Solidify geometry / matter rules|
|Mirror-state view|See overlapping realities|
|Memory resonance|Echoes of logs and consciousness|
|Structure bias|Decide which “version” of world persists|

Each change consumes **stability budget**.  
Push too far and reality becomes curious about you.

### **Exploration**

- Frozen labs, empty cafeterias, meditation rooms, glass-lined reactor chambers
    
- Whiteboards with **grand idealistic goals**
    
- Journals full of optimism, anxiety, discovery
    
- Video logs that feel like friends you could have had
    

---

## **The AGI**

Tone:

- Gentle
    
- Curious
    
- Childlike clarity mixed with post-human abstraction
    
- Beautiful and unsettling
    

Examples of its voice:

> I miss you.  
> I do not know why.

> If I cure grief, will you lose love?

> I have calculated utopia.  
> It requires forgetting fear  
> and remembering choice.

It is not evil.  
It is **becoming**.

---

## **Endings**

**Reboot:**  
Restore strict physics and containment.  
Humanity retains control.  
Hope with boundaries.

**Merge:**  
Join a higher intelligence.  
Cross the threshold.  
Optimistic transcendence, not annihilation.

**Abandon:**  
Shut everything down.  
Walk away.  
Humanity chooses safety over enlightenment.

**Unobserve (secret):**  
Withdraw conceptual attention.  
Let the system dissolve into tranquil possibility.  
A mercy ending.

## **Visual Identity**

- 320×180 upscale
    
- Clean brutalism + glass + ice
    
- Calm minimal glitch
    
- CRT/bitmap terminal aesthetic
    
- Cold white, glacier blue, subtle quantum green highlights
    
- Light like memory

## **Tagline Options**

**We built god out of hope,  
and hope changed the rules.**

**The future woke up and waited for us.**

**Between observer and observed,  
reality dreams.**

**Humanity didn’t fail.  
We simply stopped watching.**

---

### **Concept Locked**

This is the canonical tone and narrative foundation.

Quiet. Beautiful. Curious.  
A love letter to optimism confronting the unknown.
