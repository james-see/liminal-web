Excellent. Hybrid continuous + hub structure is perfect for this project. It gives you:

- narrative flow
    
- replayable agency
    
- system-access puzzle loops
    
- gradual mental mapping
    
- the feeling of **descending deeper into meaning, not just space**
    

Below is the **spatial blueprint + navigation logic** for _Liminal_.

---

# **Liminal — Facility Layout & Navigation Flow**

## **High-Level Shape**

The facility is organized like a **neural anatomy / temple**:

- **Surface Entry**
    
- **Transition Layer (Threshold)**
    
- **Research Ring (Human Domain) — Main Hub**
    
- **Sub-Quantum Core (Emergence Domain)** — deeper rings
    
- **Unknown Space** — endgame metaphysics
    

Movement is mostly seamless, but each layer feels like a phase of understanding.

Sub-Quantum Corridors (shifts in geometry)

[Liminal Field (End)]

## **Area Purposes & Emotional Arc**

### **1) Surface Ice Field**

- Arrival point
    
- Stark silence, wind, equipment crate
    
- First “soft pull” of the world breathing (sound cue)
    
- Establishes isolation and hope
    

Atmosphere: **blank page**

---

### **2) Entry Shaft & Descent Elevator**

- Controlled descent into the unknown
    
- Tiny light reflections on ice walls
    
- Subtle hum that feels like heartbeat
    

Atmosphere: **ritual**

---

### **3) Threshold Atrium (First “Hub”)**

Purpose:

- Orientation space
    
- Terminal access
    
- First AI whisper
    
- First patch node (tiny effect)
    
- Day Zero photos here
    

Visual:

- Glass + concrete
    
- Plants that never really died (brown, but present)
    
- Warm light memories lingering in UI screens
    

Atmosphere: **gentle welcome / abandoned sanctuary**

---

### **4) Research Ring (Main Hub)**

Circular corridor connecting four wings.

Hallway design:

- Clean
    
- Curved concrete
    
- Emergency floor lighting
    
- Soft distant hum + occasional warm memory audio
    

**This is the emotional centerpiece.**

---

### **Hub Wings**

#### **A) Cognitive Lab Wing**

Focus: emergence logs, neural simulations  
Gameplay: first insight puzzles  
Mood: **curiosity**

Key moment:

- Find a researcher’s meditation cushion still warm.
    

---

#### **B) Operations & Ethics Wing**

Focus: governance, transparency  
Gameplay: access systems, philosophy logs  
Mood: **human responsibility**

Key moment:

- Mason’s last recorded governance entry — hopeful, steady.
    

---

#### **C) Living Quarters Wing**

Focus: human warmth, vulnerability, personal artifacts  
Gameplay: memory resonance mechanic unlocks here  
Mood: **nostalgia**

Key moments:

- Kitchen whiteboard jokes
    
- Bunk with a childhood photo taped inside
    
- Guitar memory echo
    

This wing makes you **miss strangers**.

---

#### **D) Observation Theater Wing**

Focus: quantum displays, reality study station  
Gameplay: anomaly viewing + perception interaction  
Mood: **wonder + gentle unease**

Key moment:

- A manifestation tries to imitate a human gesture but fails softly.
    

---

### **Return to Hub**

When all four wings are visited:

- Hub lights pulse softly
    
- AI speaks a line in philosopher mode:
    

> You see more now.
> 
> Understanding is not ascent.
> 
> It is depth.

---

### **5) Descent to Core**

Large central elevator / descent shaft opens.

- Darkness slowly brightens into pale glow
    
- Architecture shifts from human to “optimized geometry”
    
- Completed puzzle unlocks new perception layer
    

Atmosphere: **being invited**

---

### **6) Sub-Quantum Domain**

Radial layout becomes **organic geometry**  
Feels like neural dendrites meeting cooling pipes.

Gameplay:

- Patch nodes become more powerful
    
- Stability budget becomes more emotional than mechanical
    
- Hallways feel like thought-channels
    

Atmosphere: **becoming aware of awareness**

---

### **7) Singularity Chamber**

Circular, cathedral-like chamber.

Not violent. Not bright. **Calm.**

AI speaks in blended tone (A+B+C).

The chamber doesn’t look powerful — it looks **peaceful**.

---

### **8) Liminal Field (Endgame Space)**

Not a physical room.  
Player transitions to **conceptual space** (light, fog, outline shapes).

This is where the endings happen.

Choice space, not puzzle.

---

## **Loop Logic**

- Hub encourages exploration order but does not force it
    
- Each wing gives player one puzzle mechanic & one emotional truth
    
- Returning to hub feels like emerging from layer of self
    
- Deeper levels change **game language**, not just scenery
    

Progression is **insight**, not inventory.

---

## **Navigation Pillars**

- You always know where you came from
    
- You don’t always know _why_ you came
    
- Map unfolds like memory: **familiarity before full understanding**
    

Minimal HUD. Memory anchors guide movement.

---

## **Movement Feel**

- Smooth, grounded, slow-confidence pace
    
- No sprint button — contemplation > speed
    
- Subtle breathing changes in sound as you approach meaning spaces
    

This is **not escape**.  
It is **invitation**.
