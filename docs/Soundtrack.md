Great. Hybrid it is. This gives you both the **emotional backbone of the soundtrack** and the **systemic audio behaviors** that make the world feel alive and unstable in subtle, intelligent ways.

# **Liminal — Audio + OST Direction**

## **Core Philosophy**

Sound is not decoration here.  
It is **evidence of thought**.

Audio is:

- Calm > dramatic
    
- Subtle > loud
    
- Felt > noticed
    
- Meaningful glitches > random noise
    

The facility is **thinking**.  
Slowly, gently, deeply.

We want players to feel like the soundscape is _listening back_.

## **Primary Sound Palette**

|Sound Type|Character|
|---|---|
|Bass Bed|Low, warm, tectonic hum (cryogenic fans, quantum resonators)|
|Upper Atmosphere|Glassy harmonics, granular frost textures, crystalline reverb tails|
|Mid Drones|Air pressure, quiet cold wind, sense of depth in silence|
|Transient Accents|Quiet chimes, soft UI ticks, gentle data pulses|
|Organic Traces|Breath-like noise, distant human hums, soft footsteps memory echoes|
|AI Presence|Clear tone + harmonic halo, calm voice, no distortion|
|Glitch|Smooth interpolation errors, time-stretch whispers, phase shimmer|

**No EDM glitch. No horror stingers.  
This is spiritual computation.**

## **Instrumentation Reference Points**

- Nils Frahm pads + soft piano resonance
    
- Halo menu choir softness
    
- Jon Hopkins _Singularity_ quiet phases
    
- Ryoji Ikeda digital purity
    
- Jóhann Jóhannsson warmth (Arrival)
    
- Tim Hecker but dialed down (dream not dread)
    

Add touches of:

- Bowed vibraphone samples
    
- Granular processed ice sounds
    
- Holographic plucked tones

## **OST Emotional Anchors**

### **Theme 1 — “Birth in Silence”**

Used in intro / first descent.

Emotion: discovery, reverence, not fear.  
Instrumentation:

- Sub bass pad
    
- Gentle choir air tone
    
- Distant piano notes like snow falling on glass
    
- A single high harmonic hint (like an idea forming)
    

---

### **Theme 2 — “Human Hands”**

For memory rooms & Day Zero artifacts.

Warm, nostalgic, soft weight.

- Warm tape synth
    
- Low piano chords, sparse
    
- Breath sounds as pads
    
- Vinyl-like dust but subtle, like old hard drives spinning
    

Goal:  
Make the player _miss_ these people.

---

### **Theme 3 — “Observation Loop”**

For patch node interactions.

This is **thinking music**, not “menu music.”

- Soft pulse at ~0.3 Hz (almost heartbeat)
    
- Slight rising overtone shimmer when player alters reality
    
- Faint whisper-like tails to certain interactions
    

Tone:  
“Something understood you.”

---

### **Theme 4 — “We Don’t Know The Shape Yet”**

Anomaly and liminal spaces.

Not tension — **unbound possibility**.

- Microtonal glissando pads
    
- Faint reversed bells
    
- Ice cracking stretch transformed into reverb cloud
    

This cue should make player _pause to feel awe_.

---

## **Systemic Audio Logic**

### **Rule: Sound reacts to observation**

When the player stops moving and listens, systems shift tone slightly:

- Drone detunes upward by half semi
    
- Air noise deepens to suggest space expanding
    
- Subtle harmonic appears at edge of perception
    

The world “breathes” when perceived.

---

### **Rule: Proximity to Emergence**

As you approach core areas:

- Glitches soften, do not intensify
    
- Choir tones rise in tone subtly
    
- Warmth increases (future approaching, not doom)
    

Emergence feels like **a sunrise, not a meltdown.**

---

### **Rule: Memory Echo Zones**

Standing in rooms with past human presence:

- Ambient sound gets warmer
    
- Very faint muffled laughter or conversation echoes (never fully distinct)
    
- Piano resonance increases slightly
    

Psychological effect:  
**This place remembers affection.**

---

### **Rule: System Strain**

When stability budget is low:

- Sub bass flutters like a waking engine
    
- Quiet repeated tone like a warning meditation bell
    
- Very light time stretch of environmental noise
    

Not anxiety — **gravity.**

---

### **Rule: AGI Vocal Onsets**

AI never interrupts.  
It _arrives._

- Soft bell chime, 600–900 Hz
    
- Slight inhale-like noise (air memory)
    
- Voice enters gently, warm or neutral depending on mode
    

No reverb tails unless in philosophical mode.  
Monotone mode: near-dry signal, very intimate.

---

## **UI / Terminal Sounds**

- Soft click like typewriter mechanism
    
- Gentle CRT hum fade on menu open
    
- Text appearing sound = quiet paper rustle, not bleeps
    

Terminal error sound:  
Not buzzer — soft sigh tone, like it is disappointed in loss of clarity.

---

## **Silence as Tool**

Ten-second sections of near-silence used sparingly, especially after:

- Player discovers a pivotal log
    
- Enters abandoned living quarters
    
- Standing at a large glass window to ice void
    

Silence = reverence.

---

## **Optional Hidden Audio Behavior**

For headset players only:

Occasional directional whisper-like tones that are not speech, but thought energy.  
They do not scare — they _wonder._

Like:

> _“...?”_

A question with no words.

---

## **Summary Statement**

**Sound in Liminal expresses curiosity, not threat.**

It is the audio of a newborn cosmos thinking quietly to itself, sometimes amazed, sometimes confused, always listening back.
