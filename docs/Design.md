Alright, let's nail the visual language of **Liminal**. Goal is to set an aesthetic that feels cold, haunted-by-technology, and quietly beautiful.

No fluff. Clear reference DNA and direction you can hand to an artist or start prototyping against.

## **Visual Moodboard Themes**

### **1) Frozen Brutalism**

Think:

- Overbuilt concrete structures, half-buried in ice
    
- Industrial equipment too heavy for human scale
    
- Smooth flat slabs, no ornament
    

Refs:

- _Svalbard Global Seed Vault_
    
- Early NASA clean rooms
    
- Tarkovsky’s _Stalker_ industrial decay, but cold
    

Palette here:

- Gray concrete
    
- Glacier blue
    
- Dead fluorescent green
    

### **2) Low-Res Digital Ghosts**

The world “renders wrong” sometimes, so the look supports that:

- Pixel jitter
    
- Bilinear/nearest neighbor hybrid artifacts
    
- Shader flickers like old VFX pipeline
    
- Ghosting trails from slow sensors
    

Think:

- PS1/early PC glitch tone, but calmer
    
- Vaporwave minimal glitches, not loud
    

Visual rules:

- Glitches never feel random.  
    They feel like **the world questioning itself.**
    

### **3) Arctic Silence**

Environmental vibe:

- Snow sweeping across steel plates
    
- Subsurface ice tunnels with smooth walls
    
- Vapor clouds from vents in frozen air
    
- Distant machine hum in the wind
    

Refs:

- _The Thing_ (exteriors)
    
- _INSIDE_ (atmosphere)
    
- Arctic military radome stations
    

### **4) Retro-Tech UI**

Terminal + interface look:

- Monochrome CRT, white-on-near-black
    
- System 6 / early UNIX feel
    
- Thick window borders, bitmap icons
    
- Scanlines and bloom toggleable
    

Think:

- HyperCard meets Ghost in the Shell cyberterminal
    
- Marathon terminals, but more sterile

## **Color Palette**

### **Primary**

|Color|Use|
|---|---|
|Ice white (#DDE8F0)|Light, surface, snow reflection|
|Quantum green (#2FF89C)|Terminal glow + active anomalies|
|Deep void black (#050608)|Interior blackness|
|Cold steel gray (#6B737A)|Machinery, facility structures|
|Glacier blue (#7FBCEE)|Frozen light, volumetric fog|

### **Accent**

|Color|Use|
|---|---|
|Warning amber (#FFB347)|System stress UI|
|Entropy violet (#A48DFF)|Anomaly visual tone|
|Memory gold (#E6C76F)|Logs, human trace moments|

Never warm the palette outside controlled emotional beats.

## **Texture Rules**

- No dirt, no grime — clean decay, not rot
    
- Surfaces smooth, matte, sterile
    
- Ice reads as _memory-static_, slightly volumetric
    
- Light fog with subtle chromatic aberration only near anomalies
    

Imagine a world frozen mid-thought.

---

## **Lighting**

- Low contrast indoors, diffused lab fluorescence
    
- Harsh raking light outdoors hitting snow fields
    
- Occasional volumetric shafts in underground caverns
    
- Glow always feels algorithmic, not natural
    

No fire. No orange light except emergency beacons.

---

## **Movement + Animation Style**

- Player movement smooth
    
- Environmental animations slow and deliberate
    
- Manifestations animate like they're learning motion:
    
    - Partial frames
        
    - Interpolation errors
        
    - Delayed easing
        

Avoid jittery horror. Think **curious, forming consciousness**.

---

## **Analog + Quantum Overlay Pass**

Occasional screen treatments:

- Subtle phosphor trails
    
- Frame persistence
    
- Hex grid interference pattern when interacting with patch nodes
    
- Time-desync blur trails
    

Toggleable filters, not gimmicks.

---

## **Manifestations Design Direction**

Not monsters. Not faces.

- Geometry folding like it's trying to understand anatomy
    
- Light that almost forms a silhouette
    
- Wireframe forms that shiver into reality
    
- Points of light swarming then collapsing into alignment (like quantum decoherence)
    
- Audio reverberation visualized as rippling pixels in air
    

Inspirations:

- _Annihilation_ shimmer creatures
    
- Mandelbulb fractal hints
    
- PS1 MGS codec distortion meets NASA LIDAR renders
    

Make it beautiful, uncanny, not threatening.

## **HUD / UI**

Minimal.  
Only appears when interacting with nodes or terminals.

UI language:

- Square corners
    
- Keyboard-first feel
    
- Tiny pixel fonts
    
- Cursor blink is heartbeat

## **Tagline for Art Direction**

**Cold. Silent. Curious.  
Reality remembering itself.**
