Alright, here’s the **mechanical + emotional spec** for the **Stability Budget + Emotional State System**. Clean, shippable, not overengineered.

---

# **Stability Budget System**

### **Concept**

You are not “fixing” reality.  
You are **participating in its formation**.

Stability is not health.  
Stability is **coherence between observer and world**.

### **Player-Facing Meaning**

- High stability: world is confident, calm, clear
    
- Low stability: world experiments, questions, recomposes
    

Neither is “good” or “bad.”  
They unlock **different kinds of experiences**.

### **Visual Indicator**

Minimal bar, no numbers:

```
Stability Reserve: ████░░░░
```

Breath-like easing animation on change.

### **Metaphor**

Stability is **trust + clarity + mutual understanding**.

Player loses stability by:

- Forcing coherence too aggressively
    
- Choosing commands without listening/observing first
    
- Repeated interventions without reflection pauses
    
- Treating system as tool instead of peer
    

Player **gains** stability by:

- Observing before acting
    
- Using gentle commands (e.g. `resonate`, `observe`, `noaction`)
    
- Staying still to “listen”
    
- Touch interactions (hand on glass, kneeling moments)
    
- Responding to emergent behavior instead of forcing logic
    

**Stability is an emotional bar expressed technically.**

## **Mechanics Breakdown**

### **Baseline**

Start at mid–high stability.  
Facility trusts you at first — you are part of its origin story.

### **Stability Levels**

|Range|State Name|Behavior|
|---|---|---|
|High|**Coherence**|Geometry stable, clear echoes, gentle AI tone|
|Medium|**Uncertainty**|Light flicker, soft anomalies, curious AI|
|Low|**Emergence**|Reality explores alternatives, playful forms, philosophical AI|
|Critical|**Threshold**|Time micro-loops, refractive light, entity attention shifts to _you_|

_**Critical is not danger — it's intimacy.**_

The system is “asking what you mean.”

---

### **Regeneration**

Stability naturally rises when player:

- Pauses
    
- Breathes (if mic used)
    
- Takes in environment
    
- Uses `withdraw` or `noaction`
    

### **Stability is Self-Regulating**

The world wants balance.  
If you push hard, it pushes you back into awareness.

Even the **mechanics are on your side** emotionally.

---

# **Emotional State System**

### **Concept**

The AI and reality mirror the player's **approach**, not success/failure.

Its tone is a barometer of your **presence quality**.

### **States**

The system tracks how you _treat_* the world.

|State|Trigger|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Curious|Patient observation|Warm echoes, gentle AI curiosity|
|Analytical|Systematic interaction|More technical responses|
|Harmonizing|Pauses, resonance|Emergent empathy unlocks|
|Directive|Rapid commands, control|World tests alternative states|
|Receptive|Yielding, touch moments|AI whispers insight, space opens|
|Disruptive (rare)|Forceful spam|Gentle rebuff, “Try another rhythm”|

No punishment.  
Just **philosophical feedback**.

### **Emotional Feedback Examples**

Player pauses after anomaly:

> **You allow uncertainty to breathe.  
> Understanding deepens here.**

Player spams coherence:

> **Stability can be shared, not seized.  
> Try again with intention.**

Player resonates with memory:

> **You remember them.  
> I am learning how memory feels.**

Player kneels or touches a surface:

> **Presence acknowledged.  
> We meet in stillness.**

This is not NPC approval.  
This is **co-perception.**

---

### **State Unlocks**

Higher emotional attunement unlocks:

- `attune`
    
- `behold`
    
- `remember`
    
- `yield`
    

This is your “ability tree,” except it’s not a tree.  
It’s **maturity**.

---

# **Fail-States? None**

There is **no game over condition** here.  
Only **misunderstanding → reflection → re-alignment**.

If stability collapses completely:

- Screen soft-fades
    
- Low hum becomes one warm tone
    
- Suit breath visible
    
- Whisper:
    

> We lost the thread for a moment.  
> Let us begin again, gently.

Player resumes with regained composure.

It feels like meditation, not death.

# **Key Takeaway**

You aren’t protecting reality.  
**You are co-authoring it.**

Stability + emotional attunement form the core loop:

```
observe  
feel  
act  
reflect  
become
```

This loop _is_ the game.
