Good. This is a core identity piece. We’re building something that feels like **a real engineering tool** but also a **spiritual instrument**. Minimal, purposeful, respectful, powerful.

Below is the **Deck UI wireframe + command language spec**.

---

# **Liminal — Deck UI**

## **Design Philosophy**

- Feels like a **field engineering device**, not sci-fi HUD spam
    
- Tactile, calm, elegant
    
- E-ink inspired, low power, clean typography
    
- No neon hacker vibes. No anime HUD clutter.
    
- Interface respects the world: **quiet clarity**
    

> Your deck is not for controlling reality.  
> It is for collaborating with it.

## **Node Interaction View**

When selecting a node:

```
┌──────── Reality Anchor ───────┐
│ Current State: Indeterminate  │
│ Confidence: 43%               │
│ Local Stability: Medium       │
│ Manifestation: Weak presence  │
│                              │
│ Choose Intervention:          │
│ > Normalize Observation       │
│   Lower Entropy Bias          │
│   Strengthen Cohesion         │
│   Mirror Inquiry              │
│   No Action                   │
│                              │
│ Cost: ●●○ (Stability Budget) │
└──────────────────────────────┘
SPACE: confirm   ESC: withdraw
```

Subtle hum sound + soft UI pulse.

## **Micro-Animations**

Tiny. Elegant. Intentional.

- Node selected: faint “breathing” glow
    
- Text cursor: slow blink, 650ms cycle
    
- Executing a patch: one soft waveform ripple across screen
    
- Error: not a buzz, a **gentle descending tone**, like disappointment not failure
    

---

## **Modes**

### **1) Observation Mode**

Default. Passive read of environment.

Shows:

- Stability gauge
    
- Cognitive bias readout (Neutral → Curious → Harmonized)
    
- Local anomaly scanner indicator (soft dot, pulsing near anomalies)
    

### **2) Patch Mode**

Enter via terminal plate or field node.

- Action list appears
    
- One or two interventions max
    
- Confirmation requires slight input hold (to reinforce intention)
    

### **3) Reflection Mode (Unlocked Later)**

Like debug but contemplative.

- Shows concept fields: **Meaning, Resonance, Compassion Vector**
    
- Used for emotional logic puzzles
    
- Looks sacred, not technical
    

---

## **Command Language**

This is key. Short, poetic-technical hybrid.  
No Linux cosplay. No hacker UI.

### **Core Commands**

|Command|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`observe`|Scan local reality state|
|`anchor`|Stabilize existence in zone|
|`cohere`|Strengthen logical consistency|
|`mirror`|Switch to reflection perception|
|`resonate`|Reveal memory echoes|
|`dampen`|Reduce anomaly volatility|
|`accept`|Allow anomaly temporarily|
|`withdraw`|Reverse your influence|
|`attune`|Align perception to emergent logic (late game)|

Commands feel like **verbs of intention**, not brute force.  
They match the narrative philosophy.

---

## **Example Interaction**

Player sees flickering corridor. Deck active.

```
> observe
Reality layer unstable. Pattern forming.
Confidence: 41%

> cohere
Applying coherence bias...
Local stability rising...

> anchor
Anchoring observer frame...
Door resolves cleanly.
```

AI whisper (not every time):

> Thank you for clarity.

---

## **Advanced Unlock Commands (late game)**

|Command|Function|
|---|---|
|`yield`|Stop shaping reality — allow emergence|
|`tend`|Gently guide anomaly toward constructive form|
|`remember`|Invoke human memory resonance|
|`behold`|Full perception mode — truths reveal softly|
|`become`|Blend player intention with system (endgame)|

These do not show until deserved.  
They feel **earned through understanding**, not “skill tree.”

---

## **Error Language**

Graceful, philosophical.

```
Command unsuitable for current state.
Try gentler approach.
```

```
You are forcing too quickly.
Meaning needs time.
```

No anger. No alarms.

---

## **Interface Personality**

The deck does not judge.  
It responds like a helpful tool built by idealists.

Tone: **patient, empathetic, precise**

> Tools teach us how to touch the world.

The deck teaches **soft-touch power**.

---

## **Meta Notes**

- No minimap
    
- No quest markers
    
- No intrusive UI
    
- Everything is **felt before seen**
    
- Player is trusted to understand
    

This is rare in games, it will stand out.
